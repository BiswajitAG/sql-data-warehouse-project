# 🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse Project (Medallion Architecture)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).
It showcases end-to-end data engineering, from ingestion and transformation to modeling and reporting — all powered by SQL Server.

## 🧱 Data Architecture
### 🥉 Bronze Layer

Stores raw data directly from source systems.

Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server Database.

### 🥈 Silver Layer

Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.

Prepares structured data for downstream analytics and reporting.

### 🥇 Gold Layer

Contains business-ready data, modeled in a Star Schema format.

Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and analytical queries.
